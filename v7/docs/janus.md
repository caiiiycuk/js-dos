[Janus](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/) is a great web-rtc server. DOS Janus is a client implementation to work with web-rtc server. Actually emulation is runned on remote server and js-dos only render picture and send data to backend.

You can try it on the [DOS.Zone](https://talks.dos.zone/t/dos-cloud-gaming-aka-turbo/44592) site.

Running client side is simple, for example if janus runned on `127.0.0.1:8080` then code will be:
```html title="examples/ui-janus.html"
{}
```

## Backend

```TO-DO```
